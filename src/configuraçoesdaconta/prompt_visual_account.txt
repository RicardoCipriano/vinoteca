Design prompt (Português) - Simplified Account Settings screen (Vinoteca)

Design mobile screen: "Configurações da Conta" (simplified) for the Vinoteca wine app.
Goal: only editable, relevant account fields shown to user. Keep UI clean and minimal.

Requirements:
- Header: "Configurações da Conta" with back arrow.
- Sections (only):
  1) Photo (avatar) - tap to change (instruction small).
  2) Name (editable)
  3) Email (display-only with note: change via "Alterar e-mail" in Security)
  4) Country and Language (compact inputs)
  5) Appearance (System / Light / Dark buttons)
  6) Notifications (single toggle: Receive marketing emails)
  7) Security quick links: Change password, Two-factor auth (navigate, don't display heavy info)
- Footer actions: Cancel | Save Changes (primary)
- Style: calm, minimal, wine-inspired accents (burgundy #4C1C1C, gold #C9A646, off-white background).
- Accessibility: labels, touch targets >=44px, readable contrast.

Deliverables: mobile artboard, components, and a simple prototype linking Save flow. Optimize for clarity and minimalism.
